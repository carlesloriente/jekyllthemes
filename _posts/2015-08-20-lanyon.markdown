Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the Jekyll butler.

## Features

- **Sidebar menu**: A hidden sidebar that appears on click.
- **Responsive design**: Lanyon is designed to be responsive and works on all screen sizes.

## Usage

Lanyon is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup—just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for how to install and use Jekyll.

## Options

Lanyon includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.

### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

```markdown
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.

### Themes

Lanyon ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add any one of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/blob/master/public/css/lanyon.css){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

### Reverse layout

Reverse the page orientation with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```

### Sidebar overlay instead of push

Make the sidebar overlap the viewport content with a single class:

```html
<body class="sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

This will keep the content stationary and slide in the sidebar over the side content. It also adds a `box-shadow` based outline to the toggle for contrast against backgrounds, as well as a `box-shadow` on the sidebar for depth.

It's also available for a reversed layout when you add both classes:

```html
<body class="layout-reverse sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

### Sidebar open on page load

Show an open sidebar on page load by modifying the `<input>` tag within the `sidebar.html` layout to add the `checked` boolean attribute:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" checked>
```

Using Liquid you can also conditionally show the sidebar open on a per-page basis. For example, here's how you could have it open on the homepage only:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" {% if page.title ="Home" %}checked{% endif %}>
```

## Development

Lanyon has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be to submitted against `master`.**
- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**
